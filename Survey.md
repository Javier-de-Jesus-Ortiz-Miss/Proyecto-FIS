We conducted a brief survey with 10 individuals related to the music industry to validate the issue we raised. Performing this initial survey is a valuable first step in assessing the validity of the problem we identified. However, it's important to recognize that these preliminary results can serve as an introduction, and it's advisable to consider the possibility of expanding the research and collecting more comprehensive data to solidly support the identified issue
