<a Technical knowledge id="item12"></a>
### Technical knowledge
The curriculum of UPQRoo spans a duration of 40 months and includes a wide variety of courses that range from basic fundamentals to advanced areas of computer science. Notably, it stands out for the inclusion of courses related to personal and professional skills, such as emotional intelligence, cognitive abilities, leadership, and professional ethics. From a technical perspective, the curriculum covers fundamental aspects such as mathematics, algorithms, data structures, object-oriented programming, software architecture, networks, and operating systems. It also incorporates emerging and relevant areas like artificial intelligence, information security, mobile programming, and software financial analysis.

On the other hand, the curriculum at UADY has a duration of 54 months and encompasses a broad spectrum of technical knowledge in computer science. It focuses on practical and technical aspects, including algorithmics, data structures, computer architecture and organization, operating systems, and web application development. Additionally, it addresses crucial topics related to software quality, human-computer interaction, software metrics, quality assurance, and project management.

Both universities provide a strong foundation in computer science, covering key aspects such as algorithms, data structures, programming, and software architecture. UPQRoo distinguishes itself by including courses related to personal and professional skills, in addition to addressing emerging topics like artificial intelligence and information security. Conversely, UADY concentrates on essential technical and practical aspects, adding value through courses related to software quality and human-computer interaction.

<a Technical or soft skills id="item13"></a>
### Technical/soft skills
In Uady´s curriculum soft skills are stated as graduation skills, specifically, in each of the four competency areas there is a section that describes different communication, creative and emotional abilities in an unambiguous and understandable manner. the abilities are developed trough each of the classes, with an emphasis on developing soft skills through teamwork and sections where you must communicate your ideas to the class.

UPQROO´s program doesn´t include a clear description of the desired soft skills, but there are many different classes that are dedicated to the developing soft skills like “EXPRESIÓN ORAL Y ESCRITA I”, “DESARROLLO HUMANO Y VALORES”, “INTELIGENCIA EMOCIONAL Y MANEJO DE CONFLICTOS”, “HABILIDADES COGNITIVAS Y CREATIVIDAD” etc.

We personally think that Uady´s focus is more adequate since it resembles the real-world use of soft skills more where you have to apply them In different scenarios and projects, as well as being more manageable and constant trough the duration of the program.
