<a What is Software Engineering id="item1"></a>
### What is Software Engineering?
According to IEEE Standards, 1993: “The application of a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software, that is, the application of engineering to software.”

<a Program Objective id="item2"></a>
### Program Objective

#### UADY
Upon completion of the Degree in Software Engineering, the graduate will have knowledge about:
Upon completion of Software Engineering, the graduate will have knowledge about:

1. Methodologies and techniques for small and large scale software development, such as requirements development, human-computer interaction, design, construction, evolution, testing and those related to administration, such as quality assurance and administration of projects.
2. Computer sciences, which allow the viable application of algorithms, data structures and programming languages in software development.
3. Tools for the specification and modeling of software systems, as well as for the evaluation of software processes and products for their improvement.
4. Administration and optimization of time and cost of resources involved in software development.
5. The social environment to describe the social, political, ecological and ethical factors related to technological development and professional performance.
6. Research areas related to Software Engineering.

#### UPQROO
The Software Engineer graduated from UPQROO has comprehensive training based on competencies, with knowledge, attitudes, skills and abilities to automate processes through the design, development or updating of software systems, which allows him to interact in different fields of action. and perform better in the public or private company, institution or organization in the industrial, commercial and service sectors; in the areas of:

1. Design and development of quality custom and/or generic software.

<a Technical or soft skills id="item13"></a>
### Technical/soft skills
In Uady´s curriculum soft skills are stated as graduation skills, specifically, in each of the four competency areas there is a section that describes different communication, creative and emotional abilities in an unambiguous and understandable manner. the abilities are developed trough each of the classes, with an emphasis on developing soft skills through teamwork and sections where you must communicate your ideas to the class.

UPQROO´s program doesn´t include a clear description of the desired soft skills, but there are many different classes that are dedicated to the developing soft skills like “EXPRESIÓN ORAL Y ESCRITA I”, “DESARROLLO HUMANO Y VALORES”, “INTELIGENCIA EMOCIONAL Y MANEJO DE CONFLICTOS”, “HABILIDADES COGNITIVAS Y CREATIVIDAD” etc.

We personally think that Uady´s focus is more adequate since it resembles the real-world use of soft skills more where you have to apply them In different scenarios and projects, as well as being more manageable and constant trough the duration of the program
